### ðŸ§  What I learned

- How to create registration and sign in forms *(clicking the buttons leads to the page and does not use or store the information)*
- How to set the user's signed in state to show different links (Sign In or Sign Out)
- How to use a javascript library to create effects like particles and parallax tilt
- How to use an AI API's data model to trace a box over the recognized face
- How to receive and show an image by its URL, as well as send it to the API
